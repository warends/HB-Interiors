          <p>Ready for something new?  Our E-design program will allow you to connect with us remotely to complete a quick and fun design of your space.  With the information we’ve collected from your questionnaire, dimensions, photos and Pinterest inspiration, we will create a space that is just right for you!  We find the furniture and finishes and send you a list to purchase everything available online.</p>
          <p>The cost depends on the square footage of the space and your specific needs. Our design services range from something as small as choosing drapery to as in depth as redesigning your entire home. Our fee does not include the cost of furniture or materials.</p>
          <h5 class="black">Here's what we need from you:</h5>
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li>- Photos of the space from different angles in daylight and in the evening</li>
              <li>- Dimensions of the room</li>
              <li>- Inspiration images (We LOVE Pinterest)</li>
              <li>- Your feedback</li>
